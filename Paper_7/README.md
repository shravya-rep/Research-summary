# üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Reaction Paper: Ethics of AI in Social Work & Healthcare

This paper offers a thoughtful reflection on the ethical challenges and social implications of using AI in behavioral healthcare and social work. The speaker provided real-world examples‚Äîsuch as AI note-taking assistants, predictive algorithms, and chatbot therapists‚Äîwhile emphasizing the risks of bias, abandonment, and loss of autonomy.

## üîç Key Themes

- **AI in Healthcare Applications**:
  - Tools like **Woebot Health**, **Lyssn**, **AWS Healthscribe**, and **Pepper robot** showcased how AI is integrated into mental healthcare and social services.
  - The use of AI-generated podcasts and clinical note transcription brought a tangible touch to AI's real-world utility.

- **Dual Nature of AI**:
  - **Assistive AI**: Helps therapists by generating notes, reducing documentation time.
  - **Suggestive AI**: Predicts risk (e.g., child abuse) based on behavioral data.
  - But **ultimate accountability** remains with the social worker or physician.

- **Core Ethical Principles**:
  - **"Do No Harm"** and **"Care"** are central to social work ethics.
  - Highlighted risk of **false positives** in predictive models‚Äîespecially in underrepresented communities due to biased datasets.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Concerns

- **Autonomy**:
  - Users often feel forced to interact with chatbots or AI avatars before accessing human care.
  - Emotional gaps exist‚ÄîAI can't fully understand human tears or nuanced emotions.

- **Cognitive Impairment & Deception**:
  - Elderly or impaired patients may not distinguish between AI and human agents, leading to confusion or distrust.

- **Risk of Abandonment**:
  - Overreliance on AI might delay or distort human care.
  - Physicians might miss critical diagnosis cues due to unvetted AI-generated notes.

- **Governance Gaps**:
  - Lack of clear standards on ethics, regulation, and clinical deployment.
  - Advocated for steering committees and AI "Ethical Impact Statements" to address gaps in autonomy, fairness, and accountability.

## üß† Final Takeaway

AI should act as a **supportive tool**, not a replacement for human empathy or responsibility. The speaker emphasized the need for:
- Patient choice between AI and human interaction
- Strong governance via codes of conduct
- Logs of AI decisions for transparency and adjustment

Autonomy must be recognized as a **core pillar**‚Äînot just a peripheral concern‚Äîin AI ethics frameworks moving forward.
